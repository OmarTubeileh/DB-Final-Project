# DB-Final-Project

In this project, we build a database for an application for an Airport. The steps we followed for designing it are:

Step 1: Collect a set of requirements for the application that will be used to create the ER/EER diagram in Step 2

Step 2: Create an ER/EER diagram (using ERDPlus) for the requirements given in Step 1

Step 3: Map the ER/EER diagram created in Step 2 into a relational schema containing the relations (with their attributes) and the referential integrity constraints 

Step 4: Based on that relational schema, we created all database tables using Oracl, and named the database and its tables appropriately, specifying primary keys for tables. We made sure all referential integrity constraints are enforced. 

Step 5: We populated the tables with initial data, then wrote set of SQL statements to manipulate and query the database.

Step 6(Bonus): We created a front-end interface for the created database using C#.
